For the assessment of the quality of its data, Tonalities adopts a data entry protocol for the constitution of its current corpus of MEI scores, the so-called Tonalities Score Quality Validation Protocol (TSQVP). The following parameters have been systematically verified/harmonised to ensure high quality scores: 

pitches; 
rythmic values; 
distribution of the lyrics (with a particular attention to the convenable syllabification and to the prosody); 
articulation in sections or internal parts.
