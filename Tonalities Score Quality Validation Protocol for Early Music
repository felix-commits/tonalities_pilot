Tonalities aims to analyse not only the music repertoire of the tonal period, but also to explore the modal organisation of the music from the Renaissance and from the Manneristic period. Tonalities, in fact, builds on previous studies that relate the musical system to its history,24 that grant early music other conditions of truth than tonality.25 In the perspective to properly analyse also these interesting repertoires, a specific protocol, the Tonalities Score Quality Validation Protocol for Early Music (TSQVPEM) has been adopted for the musical works composed before the 17th century, fixing some specific parameters: 

the adoption of the clefs of the original source; 
the application of a uniform modern time signature taking into account the division of the ancient tempus and prolatio; 
the adoption of the integer valor; 
the conversion of the Mensurstrich in normal bar lines. 

The attention to the clefs employed in the original source is due to the fact that their position and typology is usually considered a clue-element for the modal attribution of a composition by the music theorists of that period. All the other parameters are fixed in order to provide an uniformised presentation of the score to the end user.

TSQVPEM protocol may be object of minor adaptations and modifications, due to the progressing workflow and to the forthcoming integration of other music repertories.
